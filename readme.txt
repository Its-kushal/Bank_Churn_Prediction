 Introduction

Bank Churn Prediction is a web-based application that predicts whether a customer is likely to leave the bank (churn) based on their profile and historical data. This project uses machine learning models to make predictions and offers personalized retention strategies to improve customer engagement.

The application is built with Flask for the backend, supports dynamic web forms, and employs interactive user interfaces to provide predictions and actionable insights.

 Project Structure

The project folder contains the following files and directories:
- **app.py**: Main Python script running the Flask application and implementing the prediction logic.
- **static/**: Contains `styles.css`, which provides styling for the web pages.
- **templates/**: Contains HTML templates:
  - `index.html`: Homepage.
  - `form.html`: Form for user input.
  - `result.html`: Displays the prediction result and retention offers.
  - `graph.html`: (Optional) For displaying accuracy graphs.
- **churn.csv**: Dataset used for training the machine learning models.

 Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Dataset Handling**: Pandas, NumPy

 Dataset

The dataset `churn.csv` contains customer information, such as:
- Credit Score
- Geography
- Gender
- Age
- Tenure
- Balance
- Number of Products
- Has Credit Card
- Is Active Member
- Estimated Salary
- Exited (Target variable)

 Preprocessing Steps:
1. Dropped irrelevant columns: `RowNumber`, `CustomerId`, `Surname`.
2. Encoded categorical variables like `Gender` and `Geography`.
3. Scaled features for consistent machine learning performance.

 Implementation Details

1. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Random Forest
   - K-Nearest Neighbors
   - Support Vector Machine
   - Logistic Regression

2. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80%-20%).
   - Evaluated models using accuracy score.
   - Selected the model with the highest accuracy for prediction.

3. **Retention Offer Logic**:
   - Developed business logic to generate retention offers based on customer features such as credit score, age, and balance.

 Application Features

1. **Homepage**:
   - Welcome screen with a button to start predictions.

2. **Churn Prediction Form**:
   - Input fields for customer data like age, credit score, and balance.

3. **Result Page**:
   - Displays the churn prediction result.
   - Provides retention offers tailored to the customer's profile.

4. **Retention Offers**:
   - Examples:
     - Credit score improvement programs.
     - Loyalty rewards for active members.
     - Exclusive retirement planning for senior customers.

 Retention Offers Logic

Offers are generated dynamically based on the following conditions:
- **Credit Score**:
  - Low score: Credit score improvement programs.
  - High score: VIP banking services.
- **Age**:
  - Senior customers: Special retirement planning.
- **Balance**:
  - High balance and long tenure: Exclusive benefits.
- **Other Factors**:
  - Active membership, credit card ownership, and high salary trigger respective offers.

 Future Improvements

1. Integrate more advanced machine learning models like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks.
2. Enhance the user interface with visualization libraries (e.g., Plotly, Matplotlib).
3. Add a feature to export predictions and retention strategies as a report.
4. Optimize preprocessing and feature selection for better model performance.
